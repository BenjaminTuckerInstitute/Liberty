# Liberty

Liberty, Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order, was an individualist anarchist periodical edited and published by Benjamin Tucker from 1881 to 1908.

What you can see here is transcription of Liberty scans which you can find [here](http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/liberty/) thanks to Shawn P. Wilbur and John Zube. I'd like to issue new transcriptions fortnightly on Wednesday.

Please distinguish between what is written in the Liberty and my own beliefs. I believe in nonaggression and voluntary society. If some articles in Liberty encourage aggression or deny liberty, they are in contradiction with my beliefs. It includes the views against free trade and against the subjective theory of value. I'm not against collectivism or the labor theory of value as long as they are voluntary and do not rely on aggression against man, his liberty, and property.

Use those transcriptions for good, not evil.
