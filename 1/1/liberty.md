## On Picket Duty.

Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, these three; but the greatest of these is Liberty.

Formerly the price of Liberty was eternal vigilance, but now it can be had for fifty cents a year.

Individuals on becoming adults gain their freedom. Are nations never to attain their majority?

The effect of one-half of our laws is to make criminals; the purpose of the other half is to punish them.

Holding a monopoly, the banker is the worst enemy of the human race, being its chief despoiler; without that monopoly, he is its best friend, being its greatest civilizer.

It is needless to call attention to the style of our head. It was designed by Mr. Ipsen, 18 Post Office1 Square, Boston, who, catching with artistic insight the true spirit of our purpose, has produced what every epicure in typography must pronounce a triumph of genius and a real work of art, remarkable for its originality, vigor simplicity, and strange grace.

Liberty takes pleasure and pride in its ability to present to the readers of its first issue the first authentic likeness published in America of the most famous and heroic of that little Russian band styled by the "Pall Mall Gazette" an "army of avenging angels," Sophie Perovskaya. We reproduce it from a photograph privately forwarded to us from a number distributed at London revolutionary congress, and can answer for its accuracy as a representation of the features of that noble girl. From time to time, as occasion offers, we shall print other portraits of various heroes and heroines of revolution and radicalism.

The arrival of Leo Hartmann in America is n notable event in the history of progress, his mission one with which all friends of Liberty must sympathize, and his self-introduction by a letter to the "New York Herald" giving a true and detailed account of the Moscow mine conspiracy, one of the most thrilling, absorbing, dramatic, and convincing newspaper articles ever printed. The latter shows him as a fine writer, an heroic worker, a grand man. Liberty extends to him its most cordial salutation and right hand of fellowship, and hopes, if he visits Boston, to welcome him in person, when it will do all in its power to aid him and his good cause.

It may be well to state at the ontset that this journal will be edited to suit its editor, not its readers. He hopes that what suites him will suit them; but, if not, it will make no difference. No subscriber, or body of subscribers, will be allowed to govern his course, dictate his policy, or prescribe his methods. Liberty is published for the very definite purpose of spreading certain ideas, and no claim will be admitted, on any pretext of freedom of speech, to waste its limited space in hindering the attainment of that object. We are not afraid of discussion, and shall do what we can to make room for short, serious, and well-considered objections to our views. But propagandism through the press is an expensive luxury, and it costs us too much to strike the many blows we have to give to warrant us in furnishing our opponents the hard-earned facilities of returning them.

> Down from her high estate she stept,
>
> A maiden gently born,
>
> And by the icy Volga kept
>
> Sad watch, and waited morn;
>
> And peasants say that where she slept
>
> The new moon dipped her horn.
>
> Yet on and on, through shoreless snows
>
> Stretched tow'rd the great north pole,
>
> The foulest wrong the good God knows
>
> Rolls as dark rivers roll.
>
> While never once for all these woes
>
> Upspeakes one human soul.
>
>
> She toiled, she taught the peasant, taught
>
> The dark-eyed Tartar. He,
>
> Inspired with her lofty thought,
>
> Rose up and sought to be,
>
> What God at the creation wrought,
>
> A man! God-like and free.
>
> Yet e'er before him yawn the black
>
> Siberian mines! And oh,
>
> The knout upon the bare white back!
>
> The blood upon the snow!
>
> The gaunt wolves, close upon the track.
>
> Fight o'er the fallen so!
>
>
> And this that one might wear a crown
>
> Snatched from a strangled sire!
>
> And this that two might mock or frown,
>
> From high thrones climbing higher,
>
> To where the parricide looks down
>
> With harlot in desire!
>
> Yet on, beneath the great north star,
>
> Like some lost, living thing,
>
> That long line stretches black and far
>
> Till buried by death's wing!
>
> And great men praise the goodly czar -
>
> But God site pitying.
>
> .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
>
> The storm burst forth! From out that storm
>
> The clean, red lightning leapt!
>
> And lo, a prostrate royal form!
>
> Like any blood, his crept.
>
> Down through the snow, all smoking warm,
>
> And Alexander slept!
>
> Yea, one lies dead, for millions dead!
>
> One red spot in the snow
>
> For one long damning line of red;
>
> While exiles endless go -
>
> The babe at breast, the mother's head
>
> Bowed down, and dying so!
>
>
> And did a woman do this deed?
>
> Then build her scaffold high,
>
> That all may on her forehead read
>
> The martyr's right to die!
>
> Ring Cossack round on royal steed!
>
> Now lift her to the sky!
>
> But see! From out the black hood shines
>
> A light few look upon!
>
> Poor exile, see! from dark deep mines,
>
> Your star at burst of dawn!
>
> A thud! a creak of hangman's lines -
>
> A frail shape jerked and drawn!
>
>
> The czar is dead; the woman dead.
>
> About her neck a cord.
>
> In God's house rests his royal head -
>
> Hers in a place abhorred;
>
> Yet I would rather have her bed
>
> Than thine, most royal lord!
>
> Yea, rather be that woman dead,
>
> Than this new living czar,
>
> To hide in dread, with both hands red,
>
> Behind great bolt and bar -
>
> While like the dead, still endless tread
>
> Sad exiles tow'rd their star.
